This is a Pkg in **Julia** for solution to a class of fractional differential equations and system equations.
Many advanced source codes are available in [MATLAB](https://www.dm.uniba.it/members/garrappa/software), but they are not open source projects like this one in Julia. Hence, the purpose is to develop a Julia package that numerically solves nonlinear fractional ordinary differential equations.
